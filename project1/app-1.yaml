      prune: true # Specifies if resources should be pruned during auto-syncing ( false by default ).

        duration: 3s # the amount to back off. Default unit is seconds, but could also be a duration (e.g. "2m", "1h")
        factor: 2 # a factor to multiply the base duration after each failed retry
        maxDuration: 1m # the maximum amount of time allowed for the backoff strategy
